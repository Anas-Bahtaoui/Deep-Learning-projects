## Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2021 - First Homework
## Image Classification

In this homework you are required to classify images of leafs, which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

## Homework Evaluation
The problem is a multiclass classification problem. Thus, you must provide for each image in the test set the corresponding predicted class. In the following the guidelines you must follow:

Only the training set is given. The test set is not provided. You must submit directly your code for evaluation.
The metric used to evaluate models and place the Teams in Leadeboard is the Mean Accuracy. The score is computed as

$$ MeanAccuracy = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{predictions_i = targets_i}{N} $$ 

, where N is the total number of images in the test set
